# DeepFake Detector - PRD

## Original Problem Statement
Build a deepfake detection app for Image, Audio, and Video using the Multimodel-Deepfake repository (https://github.com/akshayRkamble/Multimodel-Deepfake).

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Recharts + react-dropzone + Lucide icons
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11) + OpenAI GPT-5.2 Vision via emergentintegrations
- **Storage**: In-memory scan history for the active backend session
- **AI Engine**: GPT-5.2 Vision for image/video analysis, signal processing + GPT for audio

## Core Requirements
- Upload and analyze images for deepfake artifacts (facial features, lighting, shadows, compression)
- Upload and analyze audio for synthetic voice detection (MFCC, spectral, ZCR, pitch analysis)
- Upload and analyze video via frame extraction + multi-frame AI analysis
- Keep recent scan results in memory for the active backend session
- Display scan history with filtering
- Analytics dashboard with verdict distribution and media type breakdown

## User Personas
- Content moderators verifying media authenticity
- Journalists fact-checking media sources
- Security teams detecting AI-generated content

## What's Been Implemented (April 5, 2026)
- Full React frontend with dark tactical command center UI
- FastAPI backend with 6 endpoints (health, analyze/image, analyze/audio, analyze/video, scans, analytics)
- GPT-5.2 Vision integration for image and video deepfake detection
- Audio signal feature extraction (librosa) + AI interpretation
- In-memory scan history for recent results
- Scan history page with detail view
- Analytics dashboard with Recharts (pie + bar charts)
- All tests passing (100% frontend, 100% backend)

## Backlog
- P1: Batch upload / multi-file analysis
- P1: Export analysis report as PDF
- P2: Real-time video stream analysis
- P3: Comparison mode (side-by-side real vs fake)
- P3: API rate limiting and usage tracking
